				<h3>Liz P.</h3>
				<p>Before:</p> 
				<p>Deeply unhappy with rock bottom self esteem, Liz came to me with PCOS and pre diabetes, having struggled with obesity for her entire life. The greatest battles that Liz and I faced were psychological; she endured poor treatment from coworkers, family and partners because she truly did not believe that she deserved to be happy.</p>
				<p>After:</p>
				<p>After 18 months, Liz had dropped 10 dress sizes and an incredible total of 60kgs! She has a fulfilling job, she no longer approaches food with fear, and she does not resent her body. In November 2019 she is set to marry her wonderful, supportive partner, and I will be in the wedding party, shedding a few (okay, many) tears of pride.</p> 
				<p>“Claire becomes wholeheartedly involved in the progress of her clients. Our success is her success. She is what I would call a full time trainer, her assistance extended beyond gym hours; she cares about her client’s personal lives, provided advice on all aspects of life and listened.Claire has helped me transform into a knowledgeable, confident, adventurous, fit and genuinely happy woman and in the process, I have gained a true friend.”</p>

				<h3>Heather S.</h3>
				<p>Before:</p> 
				<p>As a nurse working demanding split shifts, Heather realised her health was suffering and she was losing confidence in her body. Having never struggled to stay slim and feel healthy, Heather had never joined a gym before and she was very nervous at the prospect of failing.</p>
				<p>After:</p>
				<p>After only 6 months of training, Heather could complete the most preposterously complex boxing combinations of any client I have ever trained. She began running every week, and was lifting weights in the gym that were heavier than her own bodyweight. Not only did she shed the extra kgs she was carrying, and build a toned and lithe body, she fell in love with fitness.</p> 
				<p>“When I first started my journey of exercising with a personal trainer I was very hesitant, I was scared of someone judging and criticising me. But Claire made me feel empowered and changed my views of personal training from one of fear to one of comfort. Claire is the perfect combination of professionalism, fun, tough and genuine interest in health both mental and physical. Because of her efforts, I am stronger, have confidence to walk in a gym and use weights and equipment, and I have better understanding between the balance of food and exercise.”</p>

				<h3>Caroline R.</h3>
				<p>Before:</p> 
				<p>Caroline and I began training in order to help heal her body. She had competed in bodybuilding in the past, and as a result, her relationship with food and her body, had suffered. From months of restricting her diet her hormones were well out of balance, and it was affecting her happiness, and impacting on the running of her business.</p>
				<p>After:</p>
				<p>Caroline has a “go hard or go home” kind of attitude that I love, however she now understands the importance of balance in order to respect, and love her body. We reversed her hormonal damage, and strengthened her joints. She came to me feeling lifeless, and now you’d be hard pressed to find a woman in her 40s with as much vitality as this incredible woman!</p> 
				<p>“I came to Claire with a list of ailments and injuries; adrenal burnout, arthritis and severely bad knees. I thought this would inhibit our training but Claire with her understanding of muscle, movement and nutrition came up with amazing training programs. I trusted Claire completely and was able to whole hardily commit to her training program and become strong and fit again. Claire has a personality that is positive and engaging; her commitment to learning and knowledge is passionate and contagious.”</p>

				<h3>Christine O.</h3>
				<p>Before:</p> 
				<p>Christine and I began training because she was deeply unhappy with her body, and as a new grandmother she knew she had to do something. Christine wanted to find a way to love herself again, and build a healthy lifestyle to ensure she could be someone her family could depend on for many years to come.</p>
				<p>After:</p>
				<p>No one believes this woman could be a grandmother! She is fit, strong, and glowingly healthy. Christine shed 17kgs and became fitter and stronger than she had ever been in her life. I don’t know about you, but I don’t know many 57 year old women who can deadlift 60kgs.</p> 
				<p>“Thanks to you Claire, you have taught me to love myself. I never thought it possible, but with your help, determination and nutritional knowledge we have succeeded of getting rid of 17 kgs! My journey was educated, fun and very rewarding. I did not feel deprived, rather I felt empowered because Claire took the time to teach me how to fuel my body with nourishing, satisfying food that I enjoyed, how my muscles work and how to get the most out of my body so that I can live a happy, active lifestyle.”</p>

				<h3>Christian A.</h3>
				<p>Before:</p> 
				<p> Coming from an Italian family, Christian’s relationship with food was one of excess. He lacked confidence in his body, and wanted to learn how to take control of his health. He had worked with a personal trainer previously to help shed the extra kgs, however he was dependent on these sessions, and wanted to learn how to programme for himself.</p>
				<p>After:</p>
				<p>Christian became an absolute knowledge sponge. He absorbed all the information I taught him and is now incredibly self sufficient. He packed on muscle, tripled his strength, and fell in love with weightlifting. Over 8 months of working together he became one of the most knowledgeable clients in the gym, and has gone on to compete in bodybuilding competitions, and even become qualified as a fitness professional himself.</p> 
				<p>“My training with Claire has completely changed the way I looked at things, in and out of the gym. During every session I would learn something new about training; whether it was techniques to improve my form, a new kind of training protocol, or different methods of cardio to make it more interesting, she knows it all! Claire has pushed me through many challenges both mental and physical which has resulted in me completely transforming my body. I wouldn’t have had the same results and knowledge as I do today if didn’t have the privilege of being her client and friend.”</p>
