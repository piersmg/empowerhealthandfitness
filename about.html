						<i class="quote">format_quote</i><p>Training with me is not just about getting a great result, it is about learning how your body works</p>
					</div>
					<p>For the past 6 years, I have been working with clients to achieve amazing results. My motto is  “knowledge is power”, and it is my passion for teaching my clients about exercise and nutrition that defines me as a trainer. I believe the education process that I put people through is just as important as the physical training we do together. For this reason I have had clients drop 20, 40, even 60kgs, others have run marathons, and one of my most proud client achievements is simply that they now wake up happy, and confident.</p>
					<p>Training with me is not just about getting a great result, it is about learning how your body works, what exercise and nutrition it responds best to, how to perform any exercise with perfect technical proficiency, and how to create your own training programmes, that really work, in the future. I want my clients to have a better understanding of exercise and nutrition than most personal trainers, and that is why they are universally successful.</p>

						<i class="quote">format_quote</i><p>I am here to tell you that the only thing you should ever aspire to is <i>your</i> best</p>
					</div>
					<div class="about-text">
						<p>The pressures facing women and men in our social media dependent society have warped our expectations of health and happiness. It is no longer good enough to be fit, strong and healthy. Instagram decides what the "ideal" male and female body types are, and we kill ourselves fighting with our bodies to achieve it. Or, worst of all, we are so discouraged by the loftiness of our aspirations and the degree of separation between what we are and what we are told we should be that we give up entirely.</p>

						<p>In an industry that constantly tells people that they're not good enough until they can lift X, or look like Y, I am here to tell you that the only thing you should ever aspire to is <i>your</i> best. Whatever that looks and feels like is up to you, but I firmly believe that the process, not just the destination, should be fun, and rewarding. Maybe you want to be able to walk up the stairs at work without being out of breath, maybe you don't fit into your favourite jeans anymore, maybe you're just hovering at a weightlifting personal best and want to push through it. The most important goal I aspire to with every one of my clients is happiness, confidence and empowerment.</p>
